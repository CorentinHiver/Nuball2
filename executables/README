This quick README allows you to use the executables in this folder.
You a have set of executables with their source code, a Makefile and some additionnal folders.

If you want to modify any executable : 
    modify the source code
    uncomment the correct 'SRCEXE := *' line
    make the executable using either : 
        make
        make debug
        make opt

If you want to know the parameters of an executable, one has to simply call the executable : 
$ ./executable
> Usage of executable ....

any specificity in the use of each executable should be written both in the documentation (Nuball2/Doc/)
and in the source code. If not contact me corentin.hiver@ijclab.in2p3.fr
